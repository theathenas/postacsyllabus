Duckles 2018-09-04 1 Introduction This syllabus is designed to collect resources and offer support, advice and suggestions for people who are leaving or have left the academy. This is a self-guided course of study for anyone who is interested in leaving academia. Those of us who wrote this syllabus have pieced together a curriculum to help ourselves make decisions about a life outside of, adjacent to or partly connected to academia. This is an effort to share the resources that have helped us. 1.1 Course Aims To help people who are leaving the academy feel less alone. To encourage those leaving the academy to see themselves as skilled and to remind them that they have a lot to offer the world. To share our honest and unvarnished commentary on the benefits and challenges of leaving the academy. To make resources freely available. 1.2 A Syllabus? Really? We use syllabi to teach content to students, why wouldn’t we put together a framework for learning more about the work of leaving the academy? There are a few reasons why I chose this format. You know what a syllabus is about if you’re an academic. You have taken classes and have read other people’s syllabi. You might have written your own. This is a comfortable format. When making your own classes you probably look at other people’s syllabi and “borrow” from them (with attribution of course). Take what you want, leave the rest. Same here. Some of this will be useful for you, some will not. Making this a syllabus emphasizes that learning the skills to make this change in your life is no different than any other skill you’ve ever learned in a class. It’s just work. A syllabus reminds you that this is doable. Plus I get to give you homework and who doesn’t like homework you’re not required to do? A syllabus changes from semester to semester. This document will do the same, staying online and shifting as I receive more resources, suggestions and ideas. 1.3 Prerequisites This syllabus will make the most sense for people who have spent time in a graduate program that is primarily designed to prepare you for a career in academia. This course presumes that you are open to a life that is somehow different from becoming a tenured professor at a university. Some examples of who might benefit from going through this text: * Maybe you’re at the tail end of a job search and you’re clear you’re not going to get an academic job you want. * Maybe you’re a grad student who knows she needs options. * Maybe you’re a tenured professor who doesn’t want to stay in academia. * Maybe you’re reaching the end of the rope where you are and you need to know you have options. Whatever stage you’re at, we get it. A few things that are not required: You don’t have to have left academia, you don’t have to make a decision about leaving. You don’t even have to know what that would look like if you did. You just need to be open. 1.4 Perpectives We embrace a critical lens in this syllabus and we look at the issues around Post Ac life from an intersectional feminist vantage point. We take for granted that those who are disadvantaged in society are also systematically and structurally disenfranchised within institutions. Because of that, we take very seriously the perspectives of women, people of color, LGBTQ, disabled, first generation college students and anyone who has typically not been fully welcomed by academic institutions. 1.5 Author The syllabus was written, edited and is maintained by Beth M. Duckles with help from contributers. Opinions are mine unless they are in quotations. This syllabus would not exist without the incredible contribution team, the female identified and gender nonbinary people who been a part of the the Athenas Slack Channel, and the generous respondents to a survey I put out for resources on Post Ac life. 1.6 Contributing I strongly encourage you (yes you!) to contribute resources, materials, feedback about books/articles/resources, ideas for assignments, or any other thoughts you have. Contributions invited by emailing postacathenas@gmail.com or submitting a GitHub issue. In your email, please indicate if you would prefer that I NOT use your name. Making your name public is not required for contributing. Unless told otherwise, if you offer comments, links, insights or any form of helpful feedback you will be listed as a contributor. Collaborators can remain anonymous either by choice or by virtue of having offered me their thoughts through anonymous surveys. I reserve the right to edit for clarity and content. My goal is to make sure that the entirety of the document makes sense. If I do not include your writing/quote/wording it is not personal. I may believe the same thing has been said elsewhere or I might not have gotten to it yet. Please be patient. I am one person, and this is a labor of love. 1.7 Caveats Please use common sense with what you read here and in the resources we share with you. We are sharing what has worked for us and while we hope it helps you too, we know that everyone is different. What works for me might not work for you. We don’t take any responsibility for your choices. 1.8 License This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution International 4.0 License.
