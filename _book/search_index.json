Really? 1.2 Prerequisites for the course 1.3 Author 1.4 Contributing", " Introduction to the Syllabus 1 Introduction to This Book This syllabus is designed to create resources and supportive materials and ideas for people who are leaving or have left the academy. There is likely a very good reason you’ve decided to search the internet for advice on leaving academia, been sent a link to this or have stumbled on this syllabus. Regardless of your stage of being in the academy, the way you’ve gotten here or your feelings about wanting to leave, you are welcome here. We probably don’t have all the answers for you, but we have a few thoughts. And we certainly know what it’s like to be where you are. Why are you here? Well there are a lot of reasons you might have decided to take a look. - Maybe you’re at the tail end of a job search and you’re not going to get a job you want. - Maybe you’re a grad student who knows she needs options. - Maybe you’re a tenured professor who doesn’t want to stay in academia for any number of reasons. - Maybe you’re not sure but just want to know what your options are. Whatever stage you’re at, you’re welcome here. You’ll also likely have a lot of emotions about this too. We’ll talk about that in Ch ?. Just know that we get it. 1.1 A Syllabus? Really? Well, why not? We use syllabi to teach content to students, why wouldn’t we put together a framework for learning more about the job of leaving the academy? There are a few reasons why I chose this as a format. Because you know what a syllabus is about if you’re an academic. You have taken classes and have read other people’s syllabi. You might have written your own. This is a comfortable format. When making your own classes you probably look at other people’s syllabi and “borrow” from them (with attribution of course). This is not only acceptable, in most fields it is normal. Take what you want, leave the rest. Some of this will be useful, some will not. By making this into a syllabus I hope to emphasize that the process of learning the skills to make this leap is no different than any other skill you’ve learned in a class. It’s just work. A syllabus reminds you that this is doable. Plus I get to give you homework and who doesn’t like homework you’re not required to do? A syllabus changes from semester to semester. This document will do the same, staying online and shifting as I get more resources, suggestions for units and ideas for how best to format this thing. I strongly encourage you to contribute to this document as you learn more. 1.2 Prerequisites for the course This syllabus will make the most sense for people who have spent time in a graduate program that is primarily designed to prepare you for a career in academia. This course also presumes that you are open to a life that is somehow different from becoming a tenured professor at a university. How different is up to you, but it’s likely not that. A few things that are not required: You don’t have to have left academia, you don’t have to make a decision about leaving. You don’t even have to know what that would look like if you did. 1.3 Author The syllabus was written, edited and is maintained by Beth M. Duckles with help from contributers. I take responsibility for this document and the opinions are mine unless they are in quotations. This syllabus would not exist without the incredible group of women and non binary people who have joined the Athenas Slack Channel for Post Academic women, the generous and thoughtful contributors and the marvelous folks who who responded to a survey I put out for resources on Post Ac life. 1.4 Contributing I strongly encourage you (yes you!) to contribute resources, materials, feedback about books/articles/resources, ideas for assignments, or any other thoughts you have. Contributions invited by completing this online survey, emailing postacathenas@gmail.com or submitting a github pull request. In all cases (except for GitHub where it will be public), please indicate if you would prefer that I NOT use your name. Making your name public is not required for contributing. Unless told otherwise, if you offer comments, links, insights or any form of helpful feedback you will be listed as a contributor. Collaborators can remain anonymous either by choice or by virtue of having offered me their thoughts through anonymous surveys. I reserve the right to edit for clarity and content. My goal is to make sure that the entirety of the document makes sense. If I do not include your writing/quote/wording it is not personal. I may believe the same thing has been said elsewhere or I might not have gotten to it yet. Please be patient if you do submit something. I am one person, and this is a labor of love. "],
["ending-your-relationship-with-academia.html", "2 Ending Your Relationship with Academia 2.1 Academia broke up with me 2.2 I broke up with Academia 2.3 It’s not a great relationship", " 2 Ending Your Relationship with Academia It’s that time of the year when school will be back in session (if it isn’t already) and many of us who have spent a large portion of our lives pacing ourselves via the academic calendar get that fall feeling. We see shiny new notebooks stacked up in stores, we start to notice the days getting a wee bit shorter and some of us start feel conflicting emotions. On the one hand, I used to love those fresh new notebooks with crisp clean pages and brand new clicky pens. On the other hand, academia and I are no longer… a thing. There is no classroom for me to stress about, no syllabus for me to procrastinate on writing and no Are you one of those people too? I figure there are three types: 1) Academia broke up with you 2) you broke up with academia or 3) You and academia have a complicated relationship. 2.1 Academia broke up with me I’m a graduate student and I didn’t pass my exams/my dissertation. I’m a graduate student and I didn’t get an academic job but I’m graduating anyway. I’m visiting/adjunct professor and this job is ending. I was denied tenure. If academia broke up with you, there is likely a disconnect between what you wanted to have happen and what happened and this manifests usually as strong emotions like grief and a sense of loss, anger and sadness. This is a set of emotions that you need to go through. There’s also probably a sense that you’re not sure WTF to do next. You put so much of yourself into this and it did not work. You may find yourself doing some self-sabotage and 2.2 I broke up with Academia I am too physically/mentally/emotionally ill to keep doing this. I was abused (emotionally/verbally/sexually). I can’t make enough money/pay back my loans with this job. I don’t want tenure here. I don’t believe in what I’m doing anymore. My family/children are in need and I have to be with them. My partner got a job somewhere else and it was too good to turn it down. I got a job offer and there were too many good reasons to take it. While difficult, you did have a choice to stay or to go and this provides both a measure of comfort as well as (if you’re the kind of person who second guesses themselves) some anxiety. You may not fully know if this was the absolute right choice, but it might have been the right choice for your family, partnership, health, long term financial future and your heart and soul. If that is true for you, please know that all of these are entirely valid reasons to leave a job. You will likely know all of this and still feel a sense of loss. The difference is that you will have had more time in your discernment process to understand that this loss has some upsides. That’s not to say that leaving academia was necessarily what you wanted, but you may have felt that you had a choice. You still likely have the WTF do I do question. And you’re figuring out what happens next for you. 2.3 It’s not a great relationship I’m a visiting/adjunct and I am not making ends meet. I’m not a cis, hetero white man so I experience microaggressions daily. It is not sustainable. I need to live in a geographic location where I want to be. My department is toxic. I can’t do this for much longer. I’m a graduate student but the constant criticism/abuse is not good for me. I’m not sure about academia as a career. I have an academic job, but there is an end date. What do I do if this academic thing doesn’t work? I’m on the never-ending postdoc track and I just can’t do another one. I don’t know who I’d be if I’m not a teacher but everything else besides my students is awful. I’m losing faith in what I’m doing. This is a challenging place to be because the situation you’re in right now probably feels pretty shitty and you’re not sure that you want to keep doing it. At the same time. There are three things I will say throughout the entirety of this book and I will repeat them in as many ways as possible 1) You are not alone 2) You have skills and 3) It can get better. "],
["you-are-not-alone.html", "3 You Are Not Alone 3.1 Readings 3.2 Doing your Human Homework", " 3 You Are Not Alone Regardless of your experience, there are others who have had similar experiences and who have left the academy. There is even some evidence that you will (gasp) be happier if you leave. There are a myriad of people out there who are doing work that will help you even if you have no money, there are books you can check out from the library, concrete steps you can take and people who will talk to you. We will start with general resources and then follow up with specific resources for certain groups. 3.1 Readings What I wish I had Known - Beth M. Duckles The Professor is In Imagine Ph.D. Beyond the Professoriate Perel, Greta - “What Happens When Academics Quit? Good Things it Turns Out.” 3.2 Doing your Human Homework Leaving the academy is a huge life shift and as the child of two psychologists (yes I know), I strongly encourage post acacadmics to “deal with your shit”. Or as my mom used to call it: do your human homework. Human homework is the act of finding some way to honestly reflect on and work with any kind of dissonance or disruption within yourself. It often involves truth telling about challenging experiences you’ve had and walking through the stories you’ve told and the emotions that resulted. It is not avoiding what happened, or pretending it didn’t happen or trying to numb out. It is facing our own selves. I encourage you to do this because by facing what you’ve experienced, you are more able to heal and be a whole person. We never really finish doing our human homework, so this isn’t something you accomplish (although maybe enlightened people are done? I don’t know - I’m not enlightened). Most human homework is a set of questions, or a process that you work through when you’re facing tough times. It’s about being deeply honest with ourselves about experiences that called into conflict our core ideas about the way the world works and what we are doing here. When you’re going through transitions or difficult times doing this kind of work is vital because we are usually experiencing some sort of disruption in who we are, what we do, what we have to offer. There can be very real, very important reasons why you might not want to face all of this emotion work. Not the least of which is that you have deep trauma or childhood pains. So I strongly urge you to be gentle with yourself and to get support in doing this work. Trust yourself when something feels TOO delicate to approach. But instead of running away, consider just noting to yourself that this is not something you can approach and with as much compassion as you can, promising yourself that some day you will work with this. One of the biggest imepdements to doing this work when leaving an academic position is that many of us who are making these big transitions in our lives are also going through financial challenges at the same time. It’s can be very hard to do deep emotional work on yourself when you don’t have any money. Heck the scarcity of not having money ITSELF can more deeply aggrivate the emotional challenges you’re facing. This is entirely real, you’re not making this up and I’m sorry if that’s where you are right now. Yet you CAN still do human homework, I promise. There are a ton of resources below, go to the library and look through these books until one of them speaks to you. Another block for many academics, is that we can turn our very well-honed critical lenses onto the whole idea of doing human homework. In fields where we pride ourselves on being unbiased, looking at our inner landscape can be frightening and even deeply challenging to our core beliefs. Conversely in fields where there is a lot of discussion of mental illness or a belief that a “good” practitioner has already dealt with these things, there can be a block to being someone who has to do more work. Some of us have opinions around subfields or authors within psychology, or are resistant to spirituality or so-called “new age” work. I’m not going to take a stand on any of these things. I honestly do not care what method you consider best to examine your inner landscape. Pick anything. I just think you’ll be a more whole and effective person who is more able to do your work in the world if you do your human homework. Often as academics we can let ourselves get away with not doing our human homework because we can’t find the “right thing” or because we can believe there is something wrong with us if we need to do this kind of work. I believe that ALL people need to do their human homework in order to be whole. All of us need to take time to investigate challenging experiences, to reaffirm our core beliefs and to heal from disruptive events. All of us. If you find yourself not looking at what happened because of INSERT JUDGEMENTAL STATMENT HERE, name it for what it is: simple avoidance. Then pick a book or resource from the list below that looks the least offensive to you and try it. Something is always better than nothing when it comes to dealing with your shit. be critical and avoidant of facing our internal emotional states. Doing your human homework regardless of who you are will make you a more effective and whole human being. The world has need of your whole self and Below is a list of resources that might help. Some might intrigue you, while others may turn you off. Just find the resources or method that do speak to you and work with those. If you have other suggestions of resources for doing your human homework they are welcome. 3.2.1 Human Homework Resources Twelve Step programs (AA, AlAnon, NA, etc.) Transitions Book - William Bridges Nonviolent Communication Sedona Method Parker Palmer and the Center for Courage and Renewal A former academic and writer, Parker writes about his experiences and share insights from the Quaker tradition and his time with the retreat center Pendle Hill.

Those who write books and create workshops that help people do their human homework often do not focus specifically on the challenges that people who leave the academy face. Furthermore, academics who leave can be reticent to talk about their emotional states openly. We’ll talk a little bit about why that might be the case and go deeper into a discussion of what we can do about this. In this unit, we’re going to go through some of the emotional states that we have experienced and witnessed others experiencing. We’re going to talk about the specific challenges some of us have faced. We do this in order to normalize these challenges and to make it clear that you’re not alone if you feel these things. The goal here is to To support this discussion, we’ll refer to our own experiences, share insight from folks who have written on these topics That said, there is a growing field of so called “quit lit” and others who are becoming more open about what they’ve experienced.

["getting-a-job.html", "4 Getting a Job 4.1 Resources 4.2 Homework", " 4 Getting a Job There are libraries of books out there on how to find a job and a ton of people whose stated life purpose is to assist people in finding their life’s work. That said, it can be somewhat overwhelming to approach these libraries and armies of people when you’re a post academic because you have some very specific challenges that aren’t always fully addressed in the traditional field of job hunting. You might wonder: - Who would hire me? - What skills exactly do I have? - How do I turn my CV into a resume? - How do I talk about my research/papers/work to non academics? - How do I market my skills? (and by the way marketing is a dirty word and I’m bad at it) - What if I want to do something completely different? The purpose of this lesson is NOT to answer all these questions (sorry!) but instead to point you towards resources we found helpful, give you some homework assignments that have helped us and to remind you that you are not alone, others have gone through this. Let me now remind you that 1) other people have done this and it is doable 2) you’ve got skills and 3) you might be surprised to find that your life and work could be pretty awesome in the end. No promises but really, many of us feel that way. First off: we know that you have skills. Even if you have the most esoteric dissertation in the world, you have skills and often can teach them or use them in service to all kinds of projects. Consider what you did love about academia. Was it reading? Writing? Teaching? Was it the content you were working on? Was it the methods you were using? Did you like the meetings or prefer to hide out in the lab/library/archives? Consider your answers to these questions as you look for your job and try to find places where those skills are valued. Second, the path of finding your post ac job can be trial and error. It often does not follow a clear path and there isn’t anyone else who can know what the next step is for you to take. It can be bewildering, frustrating and incredibly scary for academics who have had the path laid out for them (take these classes, then do these exams, then write this paper etc). This kind of figure-it-out-as-you-go mentality is actually normal for non academics. If you need to be reminded of this, go talk to a friend who never went to grad school and ask them how they got their current job. You might be surprised. Third, you gotta pay your bills. Don’t discard jobs that are completely different than your academic work, if they fit for you and make you happy. There is no shame in doing work that is non academic to make ends meet. Do side gigs if you need to, start up an etsy shop, work with high school kids on their SAT prep, teach art classes, do freelance writing or editing. Consider arranging flowers, being a cheesemonger, becoming a sommelier, a bike mechanic, doing community organizing, running online seminars, Let me reiterate, there is no shame in any of these jobs. Or rather, you can feel ashamed if you really want to but you might consider that most people are not judging you. 4.1 Resources 4.1.1 Books Focused on Academics So What Are You Going To Do With That? - Susan Basalla The Professor is In - Karen Kelsky 4.1.2 Websites Jobs on Toast Versatile Ph.D. 4.1.3 Books on Offbeat Jobs Born for This: How to Find the Work You Were Meant to Do - Chris Guillibeau How to Be Everything: A Guide for Those Who (Still) Don’t Know What They Want to Be When they Grow Up Leap: Leaving a Job with No Plan B to Find the Career and Life You Really Want - Tess Vigeland Working Identity: Unconventional Strategies for Reinventing your Career - Herminia Ibarra The Art of Nonconformity - Chris Guillibeau Weird in a World That’s Not: A Career Guide for Misfits, F*ckups, and Failures by Jennifer Romolini 4.1.4 Articles Benefits of a Non Linear Career Path Post Acs are Happier than Academics 4.1.5 Entrepreneurship Disrupt Yourself: Putting the Power of Disruptive Innvoation to Work - Whitney Johnson $100 Startup - Chris Guillibeau Side Hustle: From Idea to Income in 27 Days - Chris Guillibeau Book and Side Hustle School 4.1.6 Marketing Book Yourself Solid - By Michael Port 4.2 Homework Write down ten jobs you would like to do.

["creativity.html", "8 Creativity 8.1 Homework", " 8 Creativity It may seem strange for me to have a week on creativity but in my own recovery from academia I’ve found it to be an incredibly potent tool for dealing with what I feel and think as well as a way to feel more content and happy in life. I believe we are all creative. I don’t think there are any among us who are not creative. For many academics, the creative urges have been quashed by the desire to please those who we have looked up to in our school years. We may also believe ourselves not to be creative, or to have taken to hear the kind of language that tells us that a “true” scientist/historian/professor isn’t a creative person. My number one recommendation is Julia Cameron’s “The Artist’s Way”. In that book she describes much of what has caused many of us academics a lot of pain. She does so with compassion and grace and she slowly, steadily and lovingly encourages the nascent artists inside of us out of their shell.

These documents are a particular type of discussion of the challenges in higher education. They often take a first person perspective and reflect both on the individual’s story and how this connects to the larger questions within the academy and higher education. By starting with an incomplete typology of perspectives on why people leave the academy, we get a sense of the variety of stories that are told and can reflect on how these themes may emerge in our own stories. The point is to begin to own one’s story and to take seriously how our own individual positions and experiences are connected to the larger world. Being willing to examine our own story in light of the larger structure, industry and mechanisms that we have been a part of can ease the individual burden and begin the healing process. 10.1 Readings Garber, Megan. “The Rise of Quit Lit” - Atlantic Schuman, Rebecca “Thesis Hatement” - Slate Bartram, Erin - “The Sublimated Grief of the Left Behind” Neff, Ali Colleen - “On Academic Precarity” Lee, Oliver - “I have one of the best jobs in Academia.
