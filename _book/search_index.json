Really? 1.3 Prerequisites 1.4 Outcomes 1.5 Perpectives 1.6 Author 1.7 Contributing 1.8 Caveats 1.9 License", " Post Academic Syllabus Beth M. Duckles 2018-10-12 1 Introduction This syllabus is designed to collect resources and offer support, advice and suggestions for people who are leaving or have left the academy. This is a self-guided course of study for anyone who is interested in leaving academia. Those of us who wrote this syllabus have pieced together a curriculum to help ourselves make decisions about a life outside of, adjacent to or partly connected to academia. This is an effort to share the resources that have helped us. 1.1 Course Aims To help people who are leaving the academy feel less alone. To encourage those leaving the academy to see themselves as skilled and to remind them that they have a lot to offer the world. To share our honest and unvarnished commentary on the benefits and challenges of leaving the academy. To make resources freely available. 1.2 A Syllabus? Really? We use syllabi to teach content to students, why wouldn’t we put together a framework for learning more about the work of leaving the academy? There are a few reasons why I chose this format. You know what a syllabus is about if you’re an academic. You have taken classes and have read other people’s syllabi. You might have written your own. This is a comfortable format. When making your own classes you probably look at other people’s syllabi and “borrow” from them (with attribution of course). Take what you want, leave the rest. Same here. Some of this will be useful for you, some will not. Making this a syllabus emphasizes that learning the skills to make this change in your life is no different than any other skill you’ve ever learned in a class. It’s just work. A syllabus reminds you that this is doable. Plus I get to give you homework and who doesn’t like homework you’re not required to do? A syllabus changes from semester to semester. This document will do the same, staying online and shifting as I receive more resources, suggestions and ideas. 1.3 Prerequisites This syllabus will make the most sense for people who have spent time in a graduate program that is primarily designed to prepare you for a career in academia. This course presumes that you are open to a life that is somehow different from becoming a tenured professor at a university. Some examples of who might benefit from going through this text: * Maybe you’re at the tail end of a job search and you’re clear you’re not going to get an academic job you want. * Maybe you’re a grad student who knows she needs options. * Maybe you’re a tenured professor who doesn’t want to stay in academia. * Maybe you’re reaching the end of the rope where you are and you need to know you have options. Whatever stage you’re at, we get it. A few things that are not required: You don’t have to have left academia, you don’t have to make a decision about leaving. You don’t even have to know what that would look like if you did. You just need to be open. 1.4 Outcomes If you’ve taught before, you’ve may have said to your students something to the effect of “You’ll get out of this course what you put into it”. Cheesy perhaps, but you know how true it is for self-guided study. What you get is what you put into this. It’s entirely up to you. The lessons in this syllabus will be both pragmatic about the pragmatic things you need and also realistic about the emotional state that you may be in because of what kinds of things you may have experienced. We do not see the emotions or the concrete things you need to think about as mutually exclusive. We’re going to talk not only about the specific resources that have helped us to find jobs, do work we like and to be happy outside of the academy but we’re also going to be really really honest about how shitty the academy can be, what the outcome of that pain is and how we’ve worked through it. We’re not going to gloss over how much you may have gone through. 1.5 Perpectives We embrace a critical lens in this syllabus and we look at the issues around Post Ac life from an intersectional feminist vantage point. We take for granted that those who are disadvantaged in society are also systematically and structurally disenfranchised within institutions. Because of that, we take very seriously the perspectives of women, people of color, LGBTQ, disabled, first generation college students and anyone who has typically not been fully welcomed by academic institutions. 1.6 Author The syllabus was written, edited and is maintained by Beth M. Duckles with help from contributers. Opinions are mine unless they are in quotations. This syllabus would not exist without the incredible contribution team, the female identified and gender nonbinary people who been a part of the the Athenas Slack Channel, and the generous respondents to a survey I put out for resources on Post Ac life. 1.7 Contributing I strongly encourage you (yes you!) to contribute resources, materials, feedback about books/articles/resources, ideas for assignments, or any other thoughts you have. Contributions invited by emailing postacathenas@gmail.com or submitting a GitHub issue. In your email, please indicate if you would prefer that I NOT use your name. Making your name public is not required for contributing. Unless told otherwise, if you offer comments, links, insights or any form of helpful feedback you will be listed as a contributor. Collaborators can remain anonymous either by choice or by virtue of having offered me their thoughts through anonymous surveys. I reserve the right to edit for clarity and content. My goal is to make sure that the entirety of the document makes sense. If I do not include your writing/quote/wording it is not personal. I may believe the same thing has been said elsewhere or I might not have gotten to it yet. Please be patient. I am one person, and this is a labor of love. 1.8 Caveats Please use common sense with what you read here and in the resources we share with you. We are sharing what has worked for us and while we hope it helps you too, we know that everyone is different. What works for me might not work for you. We don’t take any responsibility for your choices. 1.9 License This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution International 4.0 License.

["academic-recovery.html", "2 Academic Recovery 2.1 Three Things 2.2 How Long Will It Take? 2.3 Do I Have to Leave? 2.4 Resources 2.5 Homework", " 2 Academic Recovery In the first couple of years after leaving academia, when people asked what I did, I joked that I was a “recovering academic”. It was my way of talking to people about the weirdness of leaving an academic position for freelance jobs and not exactly having a clear plan for how everything was going to go. I wanted to be where I was, and I was doing ok. I just couldn’t shake the feeling that academia was this large thing looming behind me as I talked to people. I noticed that when I used the phrase “recovering academic” with people who had NOT spent significant time in an academically focused graduate program, it was a decent icebreaker that had some humor to it. They’d sort of chuckle and they’d ask me what projects I had these days and what I had done before. It all seemed pretty normal. It was as if I had decided to leave an industry or a profession that hadn’t been quite right for me (which - I had!). Just like someone might leave the aerospace industry to learn more about the construction industry. Sort of benign and mildly interesting, but not at all unusual. There was a palpable difference when people who understood what it meant to leave an academic position responded to the phrase. They knew exactly what I meant when I said I was a recovering academic. They didn’t laugh, but instead they were often sincere and some of them even checked in to make sure I was doing ok. Some would tell me a story of someone they knew who had left or about their choice not to finish a PhD or their friend who had done something similar. They seemed to understand I had really left something and was in fact recovering. The more this happened, the more I started to wonder about this phrase that I was using so lightly. Why was it that some people seemed to see this change that I had made as simply a change in my employment while other people were seeing this as a really big life change. Certainly, it was a big transition, but why was I still feeling so tied to the academy when I no longer received a paycheck from a university? If I was a recovering academic, I began to get curious about what it was that I recovering FROM? This question is the starting place of the post ac syllabus. What are we recovering from? What is the hold that academia has over us? I suspect there are as many answers to this question as there are recovering academics, but if you feel like there is an invisible string that keeps you attached to the academy, you aren’t alone. What is it that keeps us attached? What do we need to get over? I’m going to suggest that if we are going to actually recover from academia, It’s important to get a handle on our own story, to figure out what happened to us, or perhaps what is still happening to us. Recovering from academia means responding to whatever pains and challenges happened to us, acknowledging the loss and and choosing to take new steps forward. We need to be able to talk about our story and be the owner of it. 2.1 Three Things There are three things I will say as many ways as possible and from as many voices as I can throughout this course. In my experience of talking with Post Acs, these are the things you most need to hear. 1. You are not alone. 2. You have skills. 3. It can get better. Regardless of what you’ve gone through, there are others who have had similar experiences. Maybe not exactly the same thing you’ve experienced but there are people who get it and who have moved through an experience that is like yours. Honestly. It may feel like no one else who has been where you are, but really truly - you’re not alone. If you made it into a graduate program, you have skills. If you made it out of a graduate program, you also have skills. I know this can be hard to remember if you’ve internalized the critical commentary, abusive behavior, and the fact that you gained an incredibly specific skill set. But I promise, you really really do have abilities and resources that you can trade for money. It might take a while to find those and to know how to market them, but you do have skills. While it’s not universally true, most people who are potential Post Ac’s don’t completely understand that life can be pretty darn marvelous on the other side of the ivory tower. It’s certainly not perfect, there are substantial differences to academic life and it can be hard in it’s own way. But there is some evidence that you will (gasp) be happier if you leave academia. “I didn’t have a choice: I wanted to stay in academy but couldn’t find a job. Or at least wasn’t willing to pursue post-docs outside the country in order to eventually get a job. I guess during the time I was feeling the height of that rejection I wish I knew how many smart people in my field who are outside academia and happy” - Anonymous “You’re not worthless, and neither is your degree. Academia is great at convincing us we have no value. If you can get yourself to a place where you see the value in yourself and your abilities/education beyond academia, you’ll start seeing possibilities again. And that’s a really hopeful, abundant feeling.” - Anonymous 2.2 How Long Will It Take? For people who are struggling with the idea of leaving academia, an early question is “How long will it take me to find a job?” and also “How long will it take for me to feel better about this?” Obviously the answer is the intensely unsatisfying: it depends. With all honesty though, the process does take time. Possibly more time than you might want it to. Good things can happen quickly and you can get a job relatively fast, but you also are going to find that the recovery process is not something you can tackle in a month or even a couple of months. It will likely be measured in years. Which is another reason for a resource like this. Many of us who are writing and contributing to this are out of academia but we STILL find ourselves grappling with the experience now even years later. We still struggle with some of the hurts of our grad student and years of teaching. We still struggle with putting ourselves out there and dealing with imposter syndrome, perfectionism and more. &quot; Prepare for the transition, read others’ stories, know that it may take 3 years before you feel ‘normal’ again.&quot; - Anonymous “Don’t think this will be a quick transition. So many people told me it takes 3 to 6 months to adjust to a new job, but none of those people understood that a transfer out of academia is far different from switching jobs. Anticipate the adjustment taking no less than a year, but likely several more.” - Anonymous 2.3 Do I Have to Leave? By the way, when we say recovering from academia, it doesn’t mean you have to leave. Maybe it does, but maybe it doesn’t. Certainly there are quite a number of us who thought we were always going to be professors and have found ourselves doing work outside the academy that is fulfilling. For some of us, we intended to leave but have found ourselves right back in an academic job we love but was different than we had imagined. Some of us are doing the same academic work but are also doing side gigs. Still more of us have found fulfilling careers outside the academy or with one toe inside, maybe teaching a class here or there. 2.4 Resources There are a lot of resources we will share throughout the syllabus but these are some of the main resources we’ve found that were overall helpful for academic recovery. The Professor is In “Karen has some really good non-academic career advice for free on her blog!” “Breaking down the myths and socialized beliefs about academic jobs” Imagine Ph.D. Beyond the Professoriate “Straight tips and courses, as well as conferences, that help you navigate the post-ac world. Real strategies and homework even!” Wild Mind Collective Perel, Greta - “What Happens When Academics Quit? Good Things it Turns Out.” Duckles, Beth - “What I Wish I Had Known: Post Academic Women and Their Advice for Leaving the Academy” 2.5 Homework We’re going to offer some “homework” assignments in each section which will ask you to take what we’ve talked about and reflect. These are (of course) your choice to do, or not do. But they’ve helped us to reflect on our experiences. 2.5.1 Metaphors Exercise We often use metaphors in academic recovery that can help us to understand the challenges we’ve faced as academics. In this exercise there will be a series of questions that ask you to look at different metaphors that might help you tell your stories and to be intentional about which stories make the most sense for you. Grab a piece of paper and set a timer to spend 10 minutes writing on each metaphor. 1) Academia as a Relationship If you were to describe your time in academia as a romantic relationship, what would that look like? What were you attracted to? What were your hopes and fears about the relationship when you started it? When did the relationship change? Did academia become an unrequited love? an indifferent partner? an abusive partner? Was academia aware of your needs? What were the good times like? What were the crappy times like? What does the ending of the relationship look like for you? Is it a painful divorce? An amicable parting of ways? A tentative separation? Did you break up with academia? Did academia break up with you? Was (is) your relationship with academia “complicated”? 2) Academia as an Addiction If you were to refer to academia as something you are addicted to - what is the part that entices you? What is it about academia that is seductive and calls you back to it? Consider a high point of your academic time, what was it that you enjoyed about the academic system? What did you want more of? Was there anything you weren’t able to control in academia? The system itself? The job market? Your professors or your advisor? The university? The students? The negative comments and critiques? The results of the publishing process? Where did you feel powerless? Jet - Life After Academic - A blog that discusses academia as an addiction. 3) Academia as an Ivory Tower Where were you separated from others in the course of being an academic? Were there any instances when you were not able to communicate with friends or family about what was happening? What was esoteric and hard to explain about the time you had in the academy? Where did you feel isolated? Were there times when you felt like the only person who had ever felt what you were feeling? 4) Academia as a Cult What did you believe about the academy that turned out not to be true? What were the behaviors that you were encouraged to do in order to be a “better” academic that were destructive of your individuality and your self-concept? Did the system benefit from your work in ways that were harmful to you? Let me be clear that academia is not actually a substance or a cult or an actual total institution but instead a set of institutions. This exercise is not meant to indicate that academia is the same as being addicted to as substance or being inside a cult, but rather to begin to explore where we were seduced by the system, where we see ourselves as powerless and how the system itself reinforced those things.

["structural-issues-in-academia.html", "3 Structural Issues in Academia 3.1 A Brief List of Structural Issues 3.2 The Biggest Problems 3.3 Resources 3.4 Homework: Broadening The Story", " 3 Structural Issues in Academia There has been a rise in recently years in what has been called Quit Lit or articles about quitting academia. These are articles where the writer explains the challenges were that led them to their departure from an academic position and they can range from angry pieces that explain how the system failed them to grief-ridden explications of what went wrong. They come from every corner of the academy, from full professors to adjuncts and post docs. There are a lot of them. I’d like to suggest that one reason this kind of essay is resonant for those of us who have left or are considering leaving the academy is that it does something quite helpful. First, the author explains what they’ve gone through and what has happened to them. Then they describe the power structures, the institutional pressures, the cultural story and sociopolitical reasons for the challenges they have faced. In essence, Quit Lit contextualizes the story and focuses not just on the individual’s experience but how that experience is duplicated across higher education. The story is often imbued with the emotions the writer feels, but those emotions are placed within the wider lens of the system that has been problematic instead of naming the individual as the sole reason for the problem. I want to use this broadening lens to support our academic recovery. There are several reasons why a more structural perspective on higher education can be useful to those who are recovering from academia. First, these stories can help us to feel less lonely. Certainly no one else has experienced exactly what you have, but articles in the Quit Lit genre introduce the powerful question that maybe others have had something similar happen to them. Maybe you’re not the only one who has gone through something difficult. This not only makes us feel better, it also indicates how much the system has isolated us and allows us to question who benefits from that kind of isolation. Second, Quit Lit can lead us to seek out a deeper understanding of the power structures and imbalances that have been created to marginalize certain people. There are many such groups of people among them: those who are adjuncts or contingent labor, those who are pre-tenured, graduate students, women, students of color, LGBTQIA, those with children, those with disabilities etc. By seeing more clearly the power imbalances and how they have been structured and reinforced by systems, we may begin to understand the system itself has led to our experiences. We see ourselves as connected to others who also have faced this detrimental system and we can connect with others to that end. Finally, these pieces can help us recontextualize our experiences. By seeing how the institution itself has created and benefitted from what we have gone through we gain a powerful lens of critique, allowing us to see how we might have been encouraged to blame ourselves instead of for the institutions to take responsibility for the inequities the system itself creates, reinforces, sustains and recreates. The system itself is built to cause harm, and we may begin to see ourselves as having survived that system instead of failing that system. 3.1 A Brief List of Structural Issues I think it can be important to look at the structural issues at play in the individual choice to leave academia. While we often think of ourselves as having an experience no one else has, there are a number of things we can look to to see how the system may wish to reinforce or encourage us to believe we are alone. Below I’ve listed a variety of topics I’ve seen talked about in Quit Lit and Post Academic cirlces. This is likely incomplete, but I want to encourage you to think through these kinds of structural issues as they relate to your story. What resonates in your story? What fits for you? You might find a few more things that you hadn’t thought of as part of your story. What am I missing? Academic precarity and economic instability The contingent labor market and low-paid adjunct positions Not enough tenure track jobs and the competition for tenure track positions Academia is not right for me Academia is right for me but I didn’t get a job Academia is right for me but I hate teaching Unfair teaching burdens Student apathy Student entitlement Unprepared students Broken K-12 System Rise of student as customer Rise of online education Increased student tuition Student loan bloat The broken hiring process The broken tenure process The broken academic publishing process Decreased university funding Increased higher education administration Low faculty salaries Declining funding for research The declining liberal arts Anti-intellectualism Classism Geographic isolation Loneliness Grief The “two body” problem Raising a child Raising a child with special needs Having small children Incompatible careers Family illness Divorce Institutional racism Everyday racism Microaggressions Mental illness Workaholism Institutional sexism Everyday sexism Sexual harrassment Sexual assault Assault Verbal abuse Gaslighting Institutional inertia and unwillingness to address issues Unequal emotional labor workload Illegal behavior Institutional politics and infighting Sabotage The trap of post doctoral positions The trap of visiting assistant positions The trap of adjuncting Dropping out of a Ph.D program The desire to do work that matters The desire to do manual work The desire to have a life outside of academia 3.2 The Biggest Problems Consider your own departure from academia and start to investigate what you think the biggest issues are within academia. What bugged you most? What things made you the most upset? What part of the institutions were the most difficult for you to make sense of? I asked members of the contribution team to talk about what they think are the biggest problems in the academy. These are their responses. 3.2.1 Academia is Run Like a Business “The academy is run like a business This creates a ton of bad outcomes. Three that come to mind with consequences for women. 1. Departments compete for scarce resources. That helps create conditions for all manner of abuse since college leadership is still a very male culture dependent on loyalties. Male-dominated fields (STEM, business) get more prestige. 2. Undergrads and their parents are regarded as consumers. Grad students and junior faculty get subjected to popularity contests, lawsuit threats, etc. with no protection or support from administration. Women and people of color get whacked in student ratings. This also makes it impossible for women and POC to do research, pursuit of new knowledge, which is supposed to be a function of the university. 3. Administrators become the valued class who rise in prestige while contributing little to the scholarly/university community as they march from job to job every 5 years. Again, the administrator class is overwhelmingly white, and predominantly male.” - Patti Kameya &quot; The devaluation of teaching and learning encouraged by corporate and political forces that see higher ed from the capitalistic perspective of a profiteer or as an opportunity to score political points (and administrators’ kowtowing to those interests–or even hiring administrators who explicitly admire those perspectives). The result is institutions where, if spending is any indication, the value of the gym, the cafeteria, student housing, athletics, and an ever-growing system of administrative offices and projects vastly overshadows what they spend on the core mission of quality education. This is evident in hiring practices, tenure processes, funding, salaries and, of course, the practice of hiring adjuncts and graduate students to do the bulk of teaching for peanuts and empty promises.&quot; - Mark Bilbrey “The commodification of education. Universities used to be places where people who liked learning and knowledge and finding things out could come together and do that. Nowadays we’re a pay-for-parchment service that churns out disinterested students who are only in it for the piece of paper. Learning for the sake of learning is actively spurned by university administrators in favour of work skills - which I absolutely agree are important for useful graduates, but that attitude flies in the face of the whole purpose of the academic institution.” - Melinda Stanners 3.2.2 Abusive and Exploitative System “The academy is structured in a way that allows power to nullify accountability for wrong-doing. If a tenured faculty member is sexually harassing students, most of the time the problem is”solved&quot; after those students leave (rather than by removing the faculty member).&quot; - Anonymous “A startling lack of support for the most marginalized members” - Abby Bajuniemi “The academy blatantly uses women, people of color (POC), and members of other marginalized groups to help straight white men achieve promotions. They do this by saddling those women/POCs/other groups with excessive service demands that get in their way of achieving tenure while unburdening the men (making it easy for them to get tenure or ascend to Full Professor status).” - Anonymous “Absolute exploitation of junior scholars” - Anonymous “Whenever I experienced or witnessed conflicts in graduate school, mentors and administrators would invariably side with the person who had more power and privilege.”Don’t say anything“, I was told by a prominent feminist professor as a 23 year old first year student when I complained about a professor’s name calling and lack of professionalism … Disappointing, but not surprising to find that once you are part of the power structure, you begin to believe in that structure, in the justice of”due process,&quot; forgetting that when you are not a part of the power that anonymity is a protection, a way to speak without being made vulnerable to a process that regularly discounts and disregards you.&quot; - Prema Prabhakar “Almost NO recourse for adjuncts/grad students who suffer abuse at the hands (literally or figuratively) of their superiors (chairs, advisors, etc.). I was told if I wanted the abuse to stop I needed to either put up with it and kowtow to my advisor or go to a new doctoral program 3 yrs into it” - Anonymous “Misogyny under a veneer of feminism” - Anonymous “What I see EVERYWHERE is either a misalignment between mission and practice OR an inability (or refusal) to clarify a mission and make good-faith efforts to pursue it. They can’t say, after all, our mission is to make money for a few people and keep the machine operating, so we’ll do whatever it takes to accomplish that with no respect to the needs of students or employees. That would be a pretty honest mission statement at many institutions.” - Mark Bilbrey 3.2.3 Problematic Labor Practices &quot; Tenure track jobs are so rare that if you get one there is a prevailing attitude that you should consider yourself “lucky” and therefore you have no right to criticize the conditions of your work when so many others have it worse.&quot; - Kate O’Neil “Unsustainable, irresponsible, and unethical labor practices and organizational systems that encourage or even require those practices to the detriment of many.” - Mark Bilbrey “There is a structural problem in academia. Simply put, the neoliberal university model is broken. In essence, the”academic&quot; has become easily disposable labor with ever decreasing wages.&quot; - Anonymous “Despite the fact that many academics are partnered with a fellow academic or someone with similarly specialized skills, few academic institutions have policies that support dual career couples. To the contrary, academic institutions benefit from the often lower paid and contingent labor of so called”captive&quot; or “trailing” spouses.&quot; - Kate O’Neil &quot; It is much more difficult to change positions/departments/institutions in academia than outside of academia. Two contrasting examples: friend who is a professor has been sexually harassed by her chair for years, Title IX will do nothing about it, so she’s pretty much stuck with it because she can’t change departments, and can’t start at a new institution without moving her family to another city again (only one Uni in her town) – even if she could do the latter, it would take ~1 year to accomplish due to the hiring cycles in academia. In contrast, a friend started working an education non-profit, but after about 6 weeks there, she felt like her input was not being heard/valued, so she quit and went back to the place she had worked before–neither job change required moving, and the process was quick.&quot; “Forced mobility. I could have stayed in academia if I’d been ok with moving across the continent again (and sans spouse)” - Carrie Gillon “The academy lies to itself about its contributions to society. It is happy to receive student loan money, but refuses to acknowledge its role in keeping poor students poor after graduation. It pats itself on the back when students get good jobs after graduation, but refuses to pay majority of its professors (adjuncts) wages that can compete with the manager of a local McDonald’s.” - Anonymous 3.2.4 Elitism “The inability to imagine any other outcome than a professorship as the result of the PhD” - Abby Bajuniemi “It was commonly talked about that students who had academic parents had a much greater advantage in the academy than those who were”First Generation&quot; academics. This all seemed to prove true and of course, leaves the (many of us) who are not “academic legacies” scrambling to catch up….&quot; - Prema Prabhakar “Institutional elitism: No Ivy League PhD=No job prospects.” - Anonymous “Its hypocrisy: It reinforces existing systemic inequalities while spending much time, money and pages of theory purporting the opposite–the effect is indeed like a highly sophisticated version of gas lighting.” - Prema Prabhakar 3.2.5 Research and Scientific Findings “The push to publish resulting in rubbish. Not that long ago, researchers only published something when they had something to share that would add value to the world. Nowadays (gosh I sound old) there’s pressure to publish X papers a year, plus manage ever-growing teaching loads. This results in academics being unable to do real research that adds value. We’re trying to fit meaningful thinking around teaching chores, resulting in uninspired, rushed research. And being required to publish X papers a year means we’re writing papers that add no value at all, for the sake of writing papers. And that leads to a bigger problem - so much crap floating around out there, obscuring the real breakthroughs from people who want to use and apply them. The system is making a mess of knowledge generation.” - Melinda Stanners “We reward people who make bold statements and/or find unexpected results, and those are exactly the type of findings that are unlikely to be true/replicable.” - Anonymous 3.2.6 Lack of Outside Engagement “Academic jobs are structured in ways that discourage community engagement beyond the college or university. Tenure track jobs require years of focus on scholarly publication and at some institutions a combination of publication and excellence in classroom teaching. An increasing number of academics work as adjuncts, often teaching heavy loads, sometimes at multiple institutions, in order to make a living. Many are inspired to go into academia in order to contribute to society- through pro bono work, policy advocacy, writing for a popular audience, and other forms of engagement. However new academics with fresh skills and credentials have little time and limited institutional support for engaging with the world outside.” - Kate O’Neil “The echo chamber. We do research. We publish in peer reviewed articles, because that’s what we’ve been taught that we have to do for professional credibility and to further our academic careers. Our peers and colleagues read it. We nit pick over points of theory and minutiae. And NO ONE out there in the real world ever benefits from this, because we don’t publish for the world, we publish to meet requirements, and we publish where we’ve been taught it’s good for our career to publish. We don’t publish where it’s likely to actually do any good. And that makes me feel so tired.” - Melinda Stanners 3.3 Resources This section will give you a list of Quit lit articles and structural critiques of the higher education system. As always, this is a work in progress, so please contribute if something is missing. 3.3.1 Quit Lit Ahmed, Sarah - “Speaking Out” &gt; “A necessary read for anyone who identifies as a feminist and is currently or has every been attached to the academy. While the essay is particularly focused on the problem of sexual assault and harassment at universities, this discussion leads to the broader issues of power differentials and systemic inequalities that the academy reinforces. Ahmed also realized that she, as a successful member of the academy, became part of the problem, part of the power and the abuse that she sought to undermine” - Prema Prabhakar Baker, Kelly J. “On Quitting” - “She wrote of”quitting&quot; as a dignified re-articulation of the self, rather than a failure.&quot; Garber, Megan. “The Rise of Quit Lit” - Atlantic Schuman, Rebecca “Thesis Hatement” - Slate Bartram, Erin - “The Sublimated Grief of the Left Behind” She talks about what the profession loses when people quit.

She works with a number of guidelines and describes how to cultivate your own use of power in a way that enables you to see your blind spots and to do your work. 3.4 Homework: Broadening The Story In this exercise, we’re working with what has happened to us and asking some questions to examine our experiences more broadly. We want to seek a wider understanding of what happened with regard to the institutions and fields that we are a part of and start to ask these institutions and structures to be more accountable for what occurred. 3.4.1 1) Describe what happened to you. Describe something that happened that still hurts. Write out for yourself what it looked like from your perspective. Really let yourself take some time to write out the grievance and all the players in your story. If your story is too raw for you and you’d still like some practice at broadening a story. It is sometimes easier to look at other people’s stories instead of your own. Below are three examples that you can use for discussion. 3.4.2 2) Who else might have experienced something similar? Do you know of anyone else who has experienced something similar to what you have? If the answer is yes, then describe who it is. How are they similar to you? In what ways did they experience what you experienced? If you don’t know anyone who has experienced something similar, start by considering if it’s theoretically possible for others to have had something similar happen to them. If so, try to imagine who might be able to relate (yes, you are using your imagination here). Consider generalizing to a group of people. Could you imagine other women experiencing something similar at a different university? Would other junior faculty members understand this? Are there other people who are invisibly disabled who would understand? Are there others in your field who could understand your challenge? This is also a good time to look for first person accounts of such issues and in particular to see if there is any Quit Lit that is similar. Start with the resources section in this lesson and go through to see which of them is most closely related to what you experienced. 3.4.3 3) Who has power and who does not? In looking at your story, now it’s time to consider the power structure. Is there a power imbalance here? Where did you have power? Where did someone have power over you? What were the things that were out of your control? Who has recourse? Who does not have recourse? Did the power structure have any influence on what happened? Would there have been a different outcome if you had had more power or a different kind of power? Consider that there are different types of power. Original article with 5 power types here What kinds of power did you have? What kinds of power were used over you? 3.4.4 4) What role did the institution(s) play in your story? For the next question it’s helpful to think through different types of institutions that might be involved and make sure we’re thinking past just the university where you went to school or were employed. Consider also: your disciplinary area of study and sub disciplinary groups, the state, the academic publishing industry, the journal system, the student loan and banking industry, the Greek System, your alma mater, the Ivies, athletics, alumni networks, the board of directors, the academic community as a whole, heteronormativity, privilege, patriarchal structures, the boys network, What did the institution actually do (or not do)? Did anyone suggest that the institution would do something? What did they say? What actually happened? Was the power difference upheld by an institution? How? Are there hypocrisies in the actual actions taken (or not taken) by the institution? 3.4.5 5) What cultural beliefs supports those with power in your story? What are the beliefs in these institutions that you named above, or broader beliefs that may have led to supporting what happened to you? Cultural beliefs can be thought of as “the way we do things here” Some examples of cultural beliefs include statements like: * People who go to Ivy League schools/ have tenure/have Ph.D’s are smarter. * Employees will stay in their position - no matter how precarious - if the school is prestigious/they have tenure/they get enough money. * Graduate students who are parents/women/minorities/first generation don’t make it through the program. * Women are better at note taking/committee or service work/advising/mentorship/teaching than men. * Without a successful grant/published book/five articles, you won’t get tenure. * If you don’t succeed on the job market after two years/a Visiting Position/not getting an offer, you won’t get a job. * There’s no reason to hire an applicant if they: are a trailing spouse/haven’t gotten a tenure track job after two years/haven’t published a solo article. 3.4.6 6) How does your reflection on these questions lead you to retell the story you told at the beginning?What does a broader perspective add to your understanding of what happened to you? 3.4.7 Extra Credit: Fictional Stories It can sometimes help to do the Broadening the Story exercise on someone else’s story. Particularly if you’re having trouble figuring out how to do this with your own story, start by working on some fictional stories to get your mind around the task. (CW: assault) Jane is in her first year of teaching as a visiting assistant professor at a prestigious school she’d love to stay at. She was on the job market and gets an offer from a less prestigious college. She isn’t sure if she wants to take it. Ideally, she’d stay at the university she’s at and get a tenure track position, something the dean has hinted at. He said he could fund her for another year and is looking for the resources for a line for her. She hasn’t received a contract in the mail from him for the next year, though he claims that’s not a big deal. She tells him she needs a contract before the decision is requested by the university that wants to hire her. He doesn’t respond. When she takes the other job, all of her colleagues including the dean are astonished that she would leave for a “less desirable” school. Marcia is a post doc in a lab and she has been increasingly concerned about her advisor’s behavior with the international graduate students that depend on their status in the department for their visa. The advisor has made comments in lab meetings about “deportation” and joked that he can just take back their funding if they don’t do their work as quickly as he wants it done. When one grad student wanted to go home for a family funeral, the lab director made comments about her going on “vacation” and that people don’t just get time off any time they want it. Marcia has gone to the dean to talk about her advisor’s behavior. He listens and says that he’s friends with the professor and will talk to him. A week after talking to the dean, her advisor says to the lab that someone is “out to get him” and he thinks it’s one of the international students. Jake is a professor in his first year and he often travels to the city nearby to get some work done, see some friends and go on dates. He hasn’t come out to any of his colleagues and doesn’t wish to. On a night when he’s out with a date with a man, he sees a female colleague who seems shocked at seeing him kiss a man. She exclaims that she didn’t know he was gay. He considers himself bisexual but does not wish to have that conversation with his colleague, nor for his sexuality to be a part of his work environment. When he returns to campus, a colleague says something to him which makes him realize she has outed him without his consent. Use these fictional examples to go through the Broadening the Story questions. How can you recontextualize each of these stories? "]
