## Doing your Human Homework

Leaving the academy is a huge life shift and as the child of two psychologists (yes I know), I strongly encourage post acacadmics to "deal with your shit". Or as my mom used to call it: do your human homework. 

Human homework is the act of finding some way to honestly reflect on and work with any kind of dissonance or disruption within yourself. It often involves truth telling about challenging experiences you've had and walking through the stories you've told and the emotions that resulted.

It is not avoiding what happened, or pretending it didn't happen or trying to numb out. It is facing our own selves. I encourage you to do this because by facing what you've experienced, you are more able to heal and be a whole person. 

We never really finish doing our human homework, so this isn't something you accomplish (although maybe enlightened people are done? I don't know - I'm not enlightened). Most human homework is a set of questions, or a process that you work through when you're facing tough times. It's about being deeply honest with ourselves about experiences that called into conflict our core ideas about the way the world works and what we are doing here.  

When you're going through transitions or difficult times doing this kind of work is vital because we are usually experiencing some sort of disruption in who we are, what we do, what we have to offer. There can be very real, very important reasons why you might not want to face all of this emotion work. Not the least of which is that you have deep trauma or childhood pains. So I strongly urge you to be gentle with yourself and to get support in doing this work. Trust yourself when something feels TOO delicate to approach. But instead of running away, consider just noting to yourself that this is not something you can approach and with as much compassion as you can, promising yourself that some day you will work with this. 

One of the biggest imepdements to doing this work when leaving an academic position is that many of us who are making these big transitions in our lives are also going through financial challenges at the same time. It's can be very hard to do deep emotional work on yourself when you don't have any money. Heck the scarcity of not having money ITSELF can more deeply aggrivate the emotional challenges you're facing. This is entirely real, you're not making this up and I'm sorry if that's where you are right now. Yet you CAN still do human homework, I promise. There are a ton of resources below, go to the library and look through these books until one of them speaks to you. 

Another block for many academics, is that we can turn our very well-honed critical lenses onto the whole idea of doing human homework. In fields where we pride ourselves on being unbiased, looking at our inner landscape can be frightening and even deeply challenging to our core beliefs. Conversely in fields where there is a lot of discussion of mental illness or a belief that a "good" practitioner has already dealt with these things, there can be a block to being someone who has to do more work. Some of us have opinions around subfields or authors within psychology, or are resistant to spirituality or so-called "new age" work. 

I'm not going to take a stand on any of these things. I honestly do not care what method you consider best to examine your inner landscape. Pick anything. I just think you'll be a more whole and effective person who is more able to do your work in the world if you do your human homework. 

Often as academics we can let ourselves get away with not doing our human homework because we can't find the "right thing" or because we can believe there is something wrong with us if we need to do this kind of work. I believe that ALL people need to do their human homework in order to be whole. All of us need to take time to investigate challenging experiences, to reaffirm our core beliefs and to heal from disruptive events. All of us.  

If you find yourself not looking at what happened because of INSERT JUDGEMENTAL STATMENT HERE, name it for what it is: simple avoidance. Then pick a book or resource from the list below that looks the least offensive to you and try it. Something is always better than nothing when it comes to dealing with your shit. 




be critical and avoidant of facing our internal emotional states. 

Doing your human homework regardless of who you are will make you a more effective and whole human being. The world has need of your whole self and
