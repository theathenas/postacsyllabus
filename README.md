This syllabus is designed to create resources and supportive materials and ideas for people who are leaving or have left the academy. 

If you're thinking about leaving the academy or have already left. This is for you. 

Most who feel the challenge of leaving the academic career path know what I mean when I talk about leaving academia. That said, I know there are a variety of paths and that there are lots of questions about who belongs. Here (in no particular order) are some people who might find this syllabus useful. 

* An adjunct who is finding the lifestyle unsustainable.
* A visiting assistant professor who has no idea what they're doing when their contract finishes. 
* A grad student who is starting to think they don't want to do the professor thing. 
* A tenure track assistant professor who did not get tenure. 
* A tenure track assistant professor who is considering leaving  their position.
* A tenured person who is wondering if they have options. 
* A person who has gotten a job in an "academic adjacent" position. 
* A person who is trying to figure out how to live where they want to live. 
* An entrepreneur who has started her own business and has a Ph.D.

I reserve the right to edit for clarity and content. My goal is to make sure that the entirety of the document makes sense. If I do not include your writing/quote/wording it is often because I believe it has been said elsewhere, I disagree with the premise (though I might just put that in with the caveat that I don't agree) or I just haven't gotten to it yet. Edits will come when I have time. This is a labor of love, please be kind.
